<h4>I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.</h4>

<h3> Hamster : Fish </h3>

<p>Hamster is the name of my fish.  I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway.  He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him. </p>
